## What is this assignment?
In this assignment, you will select several small tasks from a list of topics compiled from throughout the semester. After completing the assignment, you should be familiar with some of the tools that were covered less extensively in lecture this semester.

## When is this due?
This extra-credit assignment will be due Friday, 12/10.

## When will I know I'm done?
When you have completed the tasks you selected during Step 1 and checked them off on the rubric in README.md, you're done!

## Step 1: Select your tasks
At the bottom of this page, you will see a checklist of tasks with their corresponding point values next to them. You can select as many tasks as you like, but keep in mind you can only earn **up to 10 points**.

To select your tasks, edit the README.md file on GitHub by clicking the pencil icon, then scrolling down to the checklist at the bottom. You will see empty brackets that look like `[ ]`. To check the box, place an **x** between the brackets so it looks like this: `[x]`. Commit your changes and move onto working on the tasks. 

*You may leave this step until the end, but make sure you remember to do it! It is important that you fill out the checklist so the grader knows which tasks to grade.*

## Step 2: Clone the respository
1. Open a terminal window
  - Windows: Open up PowerShell
  - Mac & Linux: Open Terminal
2.  On your terminal window, run `ssh purdue_username@data.cs.purdue.edu`. Replace "purdue_username" with your Purdue username. It will prompt you to enter your Purdue password. 
3. Click the green clone button (it should say "Code" with a downward arrow) on this GitHub repository and copy the URL. Make sure you are using the option "Clone with HTTPS".
4. In your terminal window, run `git clone URL`, replacing `URL` with the clone URL you just copied.
5. You are ready to go! Move onto Step 3.

## Step 3: Edit the files for your tasks 
#### (task instructions in the files)
Each task has a corresponding file with a set of instructions commented in the file. Edit the files for the tasks you selected in Step 1, using the text editor of your choice. For your reference, here is a table that lists each task and its files:

|      Task      |            File            |
|  ------------- |    ---------------------   |
| Pycharm Task   | src/pycharmTask.md         |
| JDB Task       | src/jdbTask/jdbTask.txt    |
| Code Standards | src/codeStandard.java      |
| Valgrind Task  | src/C/valgrind_task.c      |
| 182 Task       | src/"CS 182"               |
| Terminal Task  | src/Terminal/answers.txt   |


## Step 4: "Turn in" the assignment
Once you have finished editing the files for the tasks you selected earlier, be sure to *add, commit, push* your changes. Remember `git add <filename>` stages the changes in a file for a commit. `git commit -m "commit message"` commits your staged changes and adds the message of your choice between the quotation marks `" "`. And don't forget to `git push`!

Verify that all of your changes are displayed on Github, and then you're done with the assignment!
