Write your answers beneath each question below. Make sure you are in the src/Terminal directory!
Please read the prompts carefully – Some questions will ask you to specify a terminal/UNIX command, others will ask for the output of a command.


1. What terminal command would you use to find the file "sampleFile.c" in the current directory (Terminal)? Hint: Remember that on terminal, "." is a shortcut for the current directory.


2. Below, paste the output of the following command: grep sum sampleFile.c


3. What terminal command would you use to view the contents of the file "sampleFile.c" without explicitly opening the file?


4. What commmand could you use to view the manual pages for the terminal command "ls" (for a description of the command and its options)?


5. What command could you use to copy the contents of the file "sampleFile.c" to the file "copiedContents.c"? Hint: Use question 3's answer and direct the output to copiedContents.c.
