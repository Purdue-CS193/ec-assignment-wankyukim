Refer to the file called jdbTask.java in the src/jdbTask folder and write your responses here.
A jdb quick guide can be found here: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~horwitz/jdb/jdb.html

For the prompts below, write the command corresponding to each instruction. Questions 1 and 5 are answered for you.

1) Generate the jdbTask class for jdbTask.java (you must use the -g flag to debug with jdb):
    javac -g jdbTask.java

2) Run jdb on the generated jdbTask class:


3) Set a breakpoint at line 9 in jdbTask.java:


4) Set a breakpoint at the method fibonacciSequence of the jdbTask class:


5) While using jdb, print value of i in method fibonacciSequence:
    print i

6) Now you are going to debug the method fibonacciArray using jdb. First run the program normally to see the output:
    javac -g jdbTask.java
    java jdbTask
    Debug the resulting error by running jdb on the jdbTask class, setting breakpoints, printing variables, etc.
